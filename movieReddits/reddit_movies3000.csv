The Rocker (2008) it’s amazing this didn’t get 2% on Rotten Tomatoes.
I don't care what I've been told. Major Payne is comedy gold.
“I’ve been dancing with women for like 60 years” - Steven Seagal
Maximum Overdrive (1986) Stephen King’s first and only attempt at directing. Apparently he was so coked up during production that he doesn’t even remember making it. Saw this movie for the first time at way too young of an age. I’ve loved it ever since.
Bob Fosse as a snake is The Little Prince is one of the best worst things I’ve ever seen

"The Movie ""It's Pat"" based on the SNL sketch of the same name, with a budget of $8 million - received $50k US and $60k Total at the box office"
A hilarious, yet objectively terrible flick
You haven’t lived if you haven’t watched this movie.
Is this the best multipack ever?
Another awesomely bad flick. Cheesy dialogue, thin plot, bad acting, but somehow I can't look away.
What Planet are you from? (2000) - all star cast but I’ve never met another person who has seen it
This fighting scene from Scooby-Doo (2002) is so iconic! Sarah Michelle Gellar was amazing as Daphne.

I saw the post about Travolta in Gotti and had to share this gem. Life on the Line is a pretty entertaining bad movie about linemen. They are men that work on power lines. And their lives are on the line. Soundtrack includes “Lineman” and “The Lineman.” They really want you to know they’re linemen.

Today would've been Robert Z'Dars' 70th birthday. In the mainstream he is most famously known as a henchmen from Tango and Cash but in the cult movie world he was the star of the Maniac Cop trilogy. He also stared in Samurai Cop & Killing American Style. R.I.P, you will be remembered in the movies
I’ve got a busy weekend ahead.
Munchie (1992) Even with MST3K this one was rough, but unriffed it was nearly impossible
Slipstream (1989) was directed by the guy who did Tron, and stars Mark Hamill, Bill Paxton, Bob Peck, Ben Kingsley, Robbie Coltrane, and F. Murray Abraham.

I saw the post about Travolta in Gotti and had to share this gem. Life on the Line is a pretty entertaining bad movie about linemen. They are men that work on power lines.

There really is no deeper pit of hell...
Grandma's Boy has the widest margin between critic/audience tomato ratings that I've ever seen
One of the most miscast movies- Western Star John Wayne as Genghis Khan
dangerous shooting
My friend and I started watching bad movies as a little hobby over a year ago and recently celebrated the 100 milestone with The Room! I figured you guys would appreciate this. Glad to see this sub more active.
With all the craziness in the world right now.. the only thing that makes sense is Mr. Wiseau‚Äôs famous quote.
Breen-19
A horror movie so bad that it transforms to a grade A comedy
I met a legend last night
I painted over some Cats screenshots. Merry Christmas, Reddit!
The Rocker (2008) it‚Äôs amazing this didn‚Äôt get 2% on Rotten Tomatoes.
I don't care what I've been told. Major Payne is comedy gold.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been dancing with women for like 60 years‚Äù - Steven Seagal
Maximum Overdrive (1986) Stephen King‚Äôs first and only attempt at directing. Apparently he was so coked up during production that he doesn‚Äôt even remember making it. Saw this movie for the first time at way too young of an age. I‚Äôve loved it ever since.
Bob Fosse as a snake is The Little Prince is one of the best worst things I‚Äôve ever seen
Prophecy (1971) - This boring ass movie just turned up in a big way
DEATH BY BEING RUN OVER BY A HORSE CAW CAW
Welp.
My favourite 'bad' movie: Eega. A high budget Bollywood film about a man who dies, reincarnates as a fly and terrorizes the man who goes after his crush.
Killer Klowns from Outer Space 10/10 that my gf and I just watched
Chopping Mall - 1986
Hate to even even mention Facebook but got tagged in this and felt it belonged.
"Black Dynamite (2009) I know this isn't a ""bad"" movie, but an amazing send up of ""bad"" filmmaking and blacksploitation. Script, acting, continuity mistakes, all amazing."
Frankenhooker (1990) Cosplay - Prosthetics and outfit made by me
Tubi CEO Combs Through Goodwill Used DVDs Looking For Movies To Upload
Beaster Day, 2014
Sylvester Stallone's way of eating pizza | Cobra (1986)
At dollar tree and I honestly don‚Äôt see one good movie
Insane Clown Posse's Big Money Hustlas on VHS. This is a tough one to get through
I got to be on the news today and I put a lot of thought into what I should wear
I might regret this but let's see where it goes
The fact that there's still people out there who find these kind of films funny really scares me
‚ÄúIv‚Äôe been singing the blues for like 40 years‚Äù - Steven Seagal
But...isn't killing Carole Baskin immoral??
"The Movie ""It's Pat"" based on the SNL sketch of the same name, with a budget of $8 million - received $50k US and $60k Total at the box office"
A hilarious, yet objectively terrible flick
You haven‚Äôt lived if you haven‚Äôt watched this movie.
Is this the best multipack ever?
Another awesomely bad flick. Cheesy dialogue, thin plot, bad acting, but somehow I can't look away.
What Planet are you from? (2000) - all star cast but I‚Äôve never met another person who has seen it
This fighting scene from Scooby-Doo (2002) is so iconic! Sarah Michelle Gellar was amazing as Daphne.
No Words Can Describe
Wow, I loved this episode of iCarly! The one where Carly and Sam made a low budget B movie
Jack of all trades.
Hoop life
I like how older movies took their time with romantic scenes [Ator (1982)]
Browsing my library trying to decide what to watch like...
I'm the only person I know who likes this dumb movie
Wild Wild West
Another awful Tornado movie.
You will swing for this, James. I SHIT YOU NOT! Men at Work (1990)
I should really fix the fact that I've never seen a Studio Ghibli film, but this movie has Billy Blanks AND Roddy Piper!
Sad news, I just heard Treat Williams has died. I shall be watching his magnum opus in his honor.
The Oscar for Best Editing goes to‚Ä¶..
Not even out yet but I can already tell it's going to be a goldmine
"Tried to watch Robocop 3 last night. This is moment that made me say ""Oh, fuck off!"" and switch to Total Recall."
This scene from Halloween Resurrection‚Ä¶
My personal favorite bad movie. Easily one of the worst films I‚Äôve ever seen. Highly recommended.
Well
Handmade movie poster for for The Room. Apparently in Ghana, all movies have gore.
Night. i love you, but please don't screw this up.
Love on a Leash. I‚Äôm fifteen minutes in and I have never watched a movie that belonged here more than this one does.
I'm not sorry for the pun
Asylum bringin it as always
A critical dud, but I got a lot of nostalgic love for this one. Also one of Keith David's best performances in my opinion.
Showgirls (1995) ...Natural Dialogue between Women
Mark Polonia‚Äôs Jurassic Prey (2015) a movie that features groundbreaking special effects and editing, should be nominated for an Oscar.
This was such a bad movie
Surf Ninjas (1993) Rob Schneider and Ernie Reyes Jr. versus Leslie Nielsen as the evil Colonel Chi

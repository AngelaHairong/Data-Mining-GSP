"""Dead Heat"" (1988) - This movie is not a bad movie, but a B-Movie. It was made by a major studio, it had a good budget, it is well written, it has a star studded cast, and it had fantastic effect. The thing holding it back was mainstream audiences were not ready for a undead buddy cop movie."

critique
Test Tube Teens from the Year 2000 (Time Babes)
Slugs (1988) I always wondered why this film didn't have at least a minor cult following - One of the grossest horror movies ever uses a wide array of satisfyingly slimy practical effects - Based on an even grosser book
“The Greasy Strangler” - If Napoleon Dynamite was a horror movie
Serial Mom (1994) John Water's Final Great Film? Kathleen Turner & Mink Stole Are Amazing - Cocksucker!!!
Deathstalker II (1987) Self Aware Parody Or Painfully Cringe Shit Flick? I Honestly Can't Tell - Rarely Does A Film So Perfectly Walk The Line
Collision Course (1989) Even in the 80's I can't imagine when this ever seemed like a good idea - Look at the films it's comparing itself to!
"The Bad Seed (1956) 8 Year Old Patty McCormack Is The Perfect Cinema Psychopath - Often Imitated, Never Duplicated"
Mindkiller (1987) Awesome cover art that the film doesn't have a chance in hell of replicating - An 80's rental era phenomenon - HP Lovecraft Vibes? Kind of reminds me of From Beyond (Which I highly recommend)
"Clifford (1994) — Adult man plays creepy, sociopathic boy with a dinosaur fixation"
"Corona Zombie (2020) a lazy, poorly written, sexist, and all around offensive movie. Would recommend 7/10"
Hiroshima (1953) Full Movie - Why are all the important anti-war films globally blocked? Extremely bleak and harrowing nuclear war film in the same vein as Threads or The Day After - Would you be willing to sign a petition to help this nearly lost film finally get a Criterion release?

"The Bad Seed (1956) 8 Year Old Patty McCormack Is The Perfect Psychopath - She Delivers, IMO, One Of The Greatest Performances From A Child Actor Ever - A Defining, Fantastic Film"
"Frankenhooker: A New Jersey mad doctor rebuilds his girlfriend with body parts from exploded hookers. He feels guilty about the idea of killing them, and performs a surgical method using a drill to his brain to calm himself and go through with the plan."

started in November of 2019 my friends and I have been watching (mostly) bad movies on Friday nights. we are about to hit 200 movies watched this weekend and here is our complete list of what has been watched. Would love some suggestions of future movies to watch as well!
Bride of the Monster (1955) Ed Wood - Bela Lugosi's final speaking role is lively & enduring - A cheesy b-movie that instantly grows on you
"""Debbie Does Demons"" (2023) - This movie really should have just been a softcore porn. It's sort of a soft-softcore porn; porn-light, if you will. All that means is that we get no sex, but a metric ass load of tits. Personifying this is big titty demon who is topless 75% of the movie."

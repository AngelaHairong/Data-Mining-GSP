My daughters new room for her birthday and her horror themed birthday party
I gotta be honest mate I really don't think he cares
Spooky season might be over, but not for Michael Myers House diorama I’ve made couple months ago!🎃 It's so realistic that it feels like Michael Myers is about to come out of the front door and offer me a cup of tea. And by tea, I mean my blood, but hey, it's the thought that counts, right?
Highest rated horror movies of 2023 so far according to RottenTomatoes

What’s that single shot from a movie that legitimately scared you?
Psycho
I love this movie. So underrated. 2005 was a year to be alive.
I'm an amputee and I usually make cosplays around my bionic arm, but trading it out for the chainsaw this time was worth it. Not completely finished yet. All is 100% handmade or thrifted.
This broke me 🤣🤣
My horror movie room.
What a lovely place to live

The Rocker (2008) it’s amazing this didn’t get 2% on Rotten Tomatoes.
I don't care what I've been told. Major Payne is comedy gold.
“I’ve been dancing with women for like 60 years” - Steven Seagal
Maximum Overdrive (1986) Stephen King’s first and only attempt at directing. Apparently he was so coked up during production that he doesn’t even remember making it. Saw this movie for the first time at way too young of an age. I’ve loved it ever since.
Bob Fosse as a snake is The Little Prince is one of the best worst things I’ve ever seen
Prophecy (1971) - This boring ass movie just turned up in a big way
DEATH BY BEING RUN OVER BY A HORSE CAW CAW
Welp.
My favourite 'bad' movie: Eega. A high budget Bollywood film about a man who dies, reincarnates as a fly and terrorizes the man who goes after his crush.
Killer Klowns from Outer Space 10/10 that my gf and I just watched
Chopping Mall - 1986
Hate to even even mention Facebook but got tagged in this and felt it belonged.

Insane Clown Posse's Big Money Hustlas on VHS. This is a tough one to get through
I got to be on the news today and I put a lot of thought into what I should wear
I might regret this but let's see where it goes
The fact that there's still people out there who find these kind of films funny really scares me
“Iv’e been singing the blues for like 40 years” - Steven Seagal
But...isn't killing Carole Baskin immoral??
"The Movie ""It's Pat"" based on the SNL sketch of the same name, with a budget of $8 million - received $50k US and $60k Total at the box office"
A hilarious, yet objectively terrible flick
You haven’t lived if you haven’t watched this movie.
Is this the best multipack ever?
Another awesomely bad flick. Cheesy dialogue, thin plot, bad acting, but somehow I can't look away.
What Planet are you from? (2000) - all star cast but I’ve never met another person who has seen it
This fighting scene from Scooby-Doo (2002) is so iconic! Sarah Michelle Gellar was amazing as Daphne.
No Words Can Describe
Wow, I loved this episode of iCarly! The one where Carly and Sam made a low budget B movie
Jack of all trades.

Sad news, I just heard Treat Williams has died. I shall be watching his magnum opus in his honor.
The Oscar for Best Editing goes to…..
Not even out yet but I can already tell it's going to be a goldmine
"Tried to watch Robocop 3 last night. This is moment that made me say ""Oh, fuck off!"" and switch to Total Recall."
This scene from Halloween Resurrection…
My personal favorite bad movie. Easily one of the worst films I’ve ever seen. Highly recommended.
Well
Handmade movie poster for for The Room. Apparently in Ghana, all movies have gore.
Night. i love you, but please don't screw this up.
Love on a Leash. I’m fifteen minutes in and I have never watched a movie that belonged here more than this one does.
I'm not sorry for the pun
Asylum bringin it as always
A critical dud, but I got a lot of nostalgic love for this one. Also one of Keith David's best performances in my opinion.
Showgirls (1995) ...Natural Dialogue between Women
Mark Polonia’s Jurassic Prey (2015) a movie that features groundbreaking special effects and editing, should be nominated for an Oscar.
This was such a bad movie
Surf Ninjas (1993) Rob Schneider and Ernie Reyes Jr. versus Leslie Nielsen as the evil Colonel Chi

Only 1 minute and still better than most stupid shark movies.
I saw the post about Travolta in Gotti and had to share this gem. Life on the Line is a pretty entertaining bad movie about linemen. They are men that work on power lines. And their lives are on the line. Soundtrack includes “Lineman” and “The Lineman.” They really want you to know they’re linemen.
Ted Cruz Has Cameo in Anti-Trans ‘Comedy’ ‘Lady Ballers’
If you can name this so bad it's brilliant movie from a single image we can be friends
Everyone talks about the Star Wars Holiday Special - nobody ever brings up the awful Ewok movies starring Wilford Brimley
Today would've been Robert Z'Dars' 70th birthday. In the mainstream he is most famously known as a henchmen from Tango and Cash but in the cult movie world he was the star of the Maniac Cop trilogy. He also stared in Samurai Cop & Killing American Style. R.I.P, you will be remembered in the movies
I’ve got a busy weekend ahead.
Munchie (1992) Even with MST3K this one was rough, but unriffed it was nearly impossible
Slipstream (1989) was directed by the guy who did Tron, and stars Mark Hamill, Bill Paxton, Bob Peck, Ben Kingsley, Robbie Coltrane, and F. Murray Abraham.

The Rocker (2008) it’s amazing this didn’t get 2% on Rotten Tomatoes.
I don't care what I've been told. Major Payne is comedy gold.
“I’ve been dancing with women for like 60 years” - Steven Seagal
Maximum Overdrive (1986) Stephen King’s first and only attempt at directing. Apparently he was so coked up during production that he doesn’t even remember making it. Saw this movie for the first time at way too young of an age. I’ve loved it ever since.
Bob Fosse as a snake is The Little Prince is one of the best worst things I’ve ever seen
Prophecy (1971) - This boring ass movie just turned up in a big way

"The Movie ""It's Pat"" based on the SNL sketch of the same name, with a budget of $8 million - received $50k US and $60k Total at the box office"
A hilarious, yet objectively terrible flick
You haven’t lived if you haven’t watched this movie.
Is this the best multipack ever?
Another awesomely bad flick. Cheesy dialogue, thin plot, bad acting, but somehow I can't look away.
What Planet are you from? (2000) - all star cast but I’ve never met another person who has seen it
This fighting scene from Scooby-Doo (2002) is so iconic! Sarah Michelle Gellar was amazing as Daphne.

Showgirls (1995) ...Natural Dialogue between Women

I saw the post about Travolta in Gotti and had to share this gem. Life on the Line is a pretty entertaining bad movie about linemen. They are men that work on power lines. And their lives are on the line. Soundtrack includes “Lineman” and “The Lineman.” They really want you to know they’re linemen.

Everyone talks about the Star Wars Holiday Special - nobody ever brings up the awful Ewok movies starring Wilford Brimley
Today would've been Robert Z'Dars' 70th birthday. In the mainstream he is most famously known as a henchmen from Tango and Cash but in the cult movie world he was the star of the Maniac Cop trilogy. He also stared in Samurai Cop & Killing American Style. R.I.P, you will be remembered in the movies
I’ve got a busy weekend ahead.
Munchie (1992) Even with MST3K this one was rough, but unriffed it was nearly impossible
Slipstream (1989) was directed by the guy who did Tron, and stars Mark Hamill, Bill Paxton, Bob Peck, Ben Kingsley, Robbie Coltrane, and F. Murray Abraham.

I saw the post about Travolta in Gotti and had to share this gem. Life on the Line is a pretty entertaining bad movie about linemen. They are men that work on power lines.

I saw the post about Travolta in Gotti and had to share this gem. Life on the Line is a pretty entertaining bad movie about linemen. They are men that work on power lines.

Sad news, I just heard Treat Williams has died. I shall be watching his magnum opus in his honor.

My personal favorite bad movie. Easily one of the worst films I’ve ever seen. Highly recommended.
Well
Handmade movie poster for for The Room. Apparently in Ghana, all movies have gore.
Night. i love you, but please don't screw this up.
Love on a Leash. I’m fifteen minutes in and I have never watched a movie that belonged here more than this one does.
I'm not sorry for the pun
Asylum bringin it as always
A critical dud, but I got a lot of nostalgic love for this one. Also one of Keith David's best performances in my opinion.
Showgirls (1995) ...Natural Dialogue between Women
Mark Polonia’s Jurassic Prey (2015) a movie that features groundbreaking special effects and editing, should be nominated for an Oscar.
This was such a bad movie
Surf Ninjas (1993) Rob Schneider and Ernie Reyes Jr. versus Leslie Nielsen as the evil Colonel Chi
"The experience we hope and strive for, every time we put on a ""bad"" movie. Look at that face. Pure joy. "

The Pest (1997)
The greatest Carrot Top movie ever made.
Daddy, would you like some sausages?
Derek Savage Is Officially Out of Control

Check out the Razzies' newest category
Only 1 minute and still better than most stupid shark movies.
I saw the post about Travolta in Gotti and had to share this gem. Life on the Line is a pretty entertaining bad movie about linemen. They are men that work on power lines. And their lives are on the line. Soundtrack includes “Lineman” and “The Lineman.” They really want you to know they’re linemen.
Ted Cruz Has Cameo in Anti-Trans ‘Comedy’ ‘Lady Ballers’
If you can name this so bad it's brilliant movie from a single image we can be friends
Everyone talks about the Star Wars Holiday Special - nobody ever brings up the awful Ewok movies starring Wilford Brimley
Today would've been Robert Z'Dars' 70th birthday. In the mainstream he is most famously known as a henchmen from Tango and Cash but in the cult movie world he was the star of the Maniac Cop trilogy. He also stared in Samurai Cop & Killing American Style. R.I.P, you will be remembered in the movies
I’ve got a busy weekend ahead.
Munchie (1992) Even with MST3K this one was rough, but unriffed it was nearly impossible
Slipstream (1989) was directed by the guy who did Tron, and stars Mark Hamill, Bill Paxton, Bob Peck, Ben Kingsley, Robbie Coltrane, and F. Murray Abraham.
Remember that time Keanu Reeves and a dolphin cured the black shakes?
This movie is so bad it actually hurts to watch (meet the Spartans)
A movie so bad, I couldn’t NOT watch it!
BRIAN BLESSED as Prince Vultan - Flash Gordon (1980) Let us celebrate sheer awesomeness of BRIAN BLESSED
Sleep Away Camp (1983) one of my all time favorites.... if you’ve never seen this movie before... do yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately
Has anyone heard of this? 'Death Race 2000'
Crust (2003) is about an English pub owner who teaches a GIANT shrimp to box
"Anyone seen this gem of bad zombie movie from the 80s? I wasn't expecting anything good but when the zombie talked at the beginning. I knew it was ""winner"" worth finishing"
The Running Man (1987) is it good good or good bad? As far as 80s cheese goes - I think it gets the balance right but I want to hear your thoughts
Tonight’s gem. Starring and Directed by Kevin Sorbo
Bow down to the king of bad movies
Velocipastor
There really is no deeper pit of hell...
Grandma's Boy has the widest margin between critic/audience tomato ratings that I've ever seen

dangerous shooting
My friend and I started watching bad movies as a little hobby over a year ago and recently celebrated the 100 milestone with The Room! I figured you guys would appreciate this. Glad to see this sub more active.
With all the craziness in the world right now.. the only thing that makes sense is Mr. Wiseau’s famous quote.
Breen-19
A horror movie so bad that it transforms to a grade A comedy
I met a legend last night
I painted over some Cats screenshots. Merry Christmas, Reddit!
The Rocker (2008) it’s amazing this didn’t get 2% on Rotten Tomatoes.
I don't care what I've been told. Major Payne is comedy gold.
“I’ve been dancing with women for like 60 years” - Steven Seagal
Maximum Overdrive (1986) Stephen King’s first and only attempt at directing. Apparently he was so coked up during production that he doesn’t even remember making it. Saw this movie for the first time at way too young of an age. I’ve loved it ever since.
Bob Fosse as a snake is The Little Prince is one of the best worst things I’ve ever seen
Prophecy (1971) - This boring ass movie just turned up in a big way
DEATH BY BEING RUN OVER BY A HORSE CAW CAW
Welp.
My favourite 'bad' movie: Eega. A high budget Bollywood film about a man who dies, reincarnates as a fly and terrorizes the man who goes after his crush.
Killer Klowns from Outer Space 10/10 that my gf and I just watched
Chopping Mall - 1986
Hate to even even mention Facebook but got tagged in this and felt it belonged.
"Black Dynamite (2009) I know this isn't a ""bad"" movie, but an amazing send up of ""bad"" filmmaking and blacksploitation. Script, acting, continuity mistakes, all amazing."

I got to be on the news today and I put a lot of thought into what I should wear
I might regret this but let's see where it goes
The fact that there's still people out there who find these kind of films funny really scares me
“Iv’e been singing the blues for like 40 years” - Steven Seagal
But...isn't killing Carole Baskin immoral??
"The Movie ""It's Pat"" based on the SNL sketch of the same name, with a budget of $8 million - received $50k US and $60k Total at the box office"
A hilarious, yet objectively terrible flick
You haven’t lived if you haven’t watched this movie.
Is this the best multipack ever?
Another awesomely bad flick. Cheesy dialogue, thin plot, bad acting, but somehow I can't look away.
What Planet are you from? (2000) - all star cast but I’ve never met another person who has seen it
This fighting scene from Scooby-Doo (2002) is so iconic! Sarah Michelle Gellar was amazing as Daphne.
No Words Can Describe
Wow, I loved this episode of iCarly! The one where Carly and Sam made a low budget B movie
Jack of all trades.
Hoop life
I like how older movies took their time with romantic scenes [Ator (1982)]
Browsing my library trying to decide what to watch like...

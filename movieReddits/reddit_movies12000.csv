Dead Heat (1988) - This movie is not a bad movie, but a B-Movie. It was made by a major studio, it had a good budget, it is well written, it has a star studded cast, and it had fantastic effect. The thing holding it back was mainstream audiences were not ready for a undead buddy cop movie.
Wild Zero (1999) A rock & roll Japanese zombie film - A cult favorite with a big following
"The U.S. avocado supply is in danger due to the ""Piranha"" tribe of cannibal women, who live in the mysterious ""Avocado Jungle"" and ritually sacrifice and eat men. The government recruits a professor of feminist studies to make contact with the women to convince them to move to a condo in Malibu 1989"

critique
Test Tube Teens from the Year 2000 (Time Babes)
Slugs (1988) I always wondered why this film didn't have at least a minor cult following - One of the grossest horror movies ever uses a wide array of satisfyingly slimy practical effects - Based on an even grosser book
‚ÄúThe Greasy Strangler‚Äù - If Napoleon Dynamite was a horror movie
Serial Mom (1994) John Water's Final Great Film? Kathleen Turner & Mink Stole Are Amazing - Cocksucker!!!
Deathstalker II (1987) Self Aware Parody Or Painfully Cringe Shit Flick? I Honestly Can't Tell - Rarely Does A Film So Perfectly Walk The Line
Collision Course (1989) Even in the 80's I can't imagine when this ever seemed like a good idea - Look at the films it's comparing itself to!
The Bad Seed (1956) 8 Year Old Patty McCormack Is The Perfect Cinema Psychopath - Often Imitated, Never Duplicated
Mindkiller (1987) Awesome cover art that the film doesn't have a chance in hell of replicating - An 80's rental era phenomenon - HP Lovecraft Vibes? Kind of reminds me of From Beyond (Which I highly recommend)
Clifford (1994) ‚Äî Adult man plays creepy, sociopathic boy with a dinosaur fixation
Corona Zombie (2020) a lazy, poorly written, sexist, and all around offensive movie. Would recommend 7/10
Hiroshima (1953) Full Movie - Why are all the important anti-war films globally blocked? Extremely bleak and harrowing nuclear war film in the same vein as Threads or The Day After - Would you be willing to sign a petition to help this nearly lost film finally get a Criterion release?
Tales Of The Third Dimension (1984) The Most WTF American Horror Movie Ending Ever - Eat Your Heart Out David Lynch - Extremely Obscure Horror Anthology
Ants (1977) TV movie infamy - Ants in your pants - Of all the things to put the killer ants on breasts must of sold best
"The Man Who Saved the World (1982) (aka ""Turkish Star Wars"") - What can I say about this movie that has not already been said? This movie is one of the most infamous bad movies of all time."
The Bad Seed (1956) 8 Year Old Patty McCormack Is The Perfect Psychopath - She Delivers, IMO, One Of The Greatest Performances From A Child Actor Ever - A Defining, Fantastic Film
Frankenhooker: A New Jersey mad doctor rebuilds his girlfriend with body parts from exploded hookers. He feels guilty about the idea of killing them, and performs a surgical method using a drill to his brain to calm himself and go through with the plan.
TRAIL OF THE SCREAMING FOREHEAD 2007 movie trailer Plot: A small town infestation of crawling alien foreheads that begin attaching to people and taking them over collides with a scientist's experiments to extract foreheadazine, and things go horribly wrong.

started in November of 2019 my friends and I have been watching (mostly) bad movies on Friday nights. we are about to hit 200 movies watched this weekend and here is our complete list of what has been watched. Would love some suggestions of future movies to watch as well!
Bride of the Monster (1955) Ed Wood - Bela Lugosi's final speaking role is lively & enduring - A cheesy b-movie that instantly grows on you
"Debbie Does Demons (2023) - This movie really should have just been a softcore porn. It's sort of a soft-softcore porn; porn-light, if you will. All that means is that we get no sex, but a metric ass load of tits. Personifying this is big titty demon who is topless 75% of the movie."
Meet The Feebles Trailer 1989
Blood Debts (1985) Undoubtedly One Of The Finest Film Endings Of All Time - Not Since Ninja Terminator Has A Film Ended With Such Nuance

Killer Klowns From Outer Space 1988 movie trailer Plot: Aliens who look like clowns come from outer space and terrorize a small town.
"Happiness (1998) ""The lives of many individuals connected by the desire for happiness, often from sources usually considered dark or evil."" - IMO Todd Solondz's two 90's films are among the finest American movies of the past 30+ years"
Orca (1977) The Humble Little PG Film That Traumatized An Entire Generation Of Children - IMHO The Best Of The Post Jaws Wave Despite It's Absurdity!
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes 1978 movie trailer Plot: A group of scientists band together to save the world from mutated killer tomatoes.
Starting in November of 2019 my friends and I have watched (mostly) bad movies every Friday night. Last night we crossed off movie 400. Here's a list of what we've wasted our lives on.
"Street Trash (1987) - I suspect many of you may already be aware of this movie. It is somewhat of a minor cult classic. A well deserved title I might add mostly due to it's impressive practical effects. ""This is the best Troma movie, Troma never made."" a fellow group member rightly observed."
But I'm a Cheerleader (1999)
The Eroticist (1972) A Lucio Fulci Sex Comedy?! A Politician Who's OBSESSED With The Female Ass - In All Honesty, One Of The Best Sex Comedies Ever

just ran across this
Bride of Re-Animator (1990) H.P Lovecraft - Talk About An Overlooked B-Movie Horror Series - Jeffrey Combs Just Kills It Each & Every Time I See Him
Desperate Living (1977) Mink Stole is one of the funniest female performers ever IMO - Communist Daycare! John Water's third 70's trash classic is peak Stole - Sexy AND crazy!
Welcome To The Dollhouse (1995) One Of My Favorites - Matarazzo Is Amazing - A Bleak Black Comedy
Basket Case (1991) Not The Worst Way To End A Low Budget Horror Series - Really Jumps The Shark/Goes Off The Rails

Ed Wood (1994) A touching tribute to a misunderstood man who would be an icon today - IMO Burton's best film ever - Firmly in my top 20 movies, and Ed Wood is one of my few heroes
Neil Breen Wants To Kill You (Well, Most of You) In His Movie Pass Thru -
Cyber Tracker 2 - discount Robocop anyone?
Psychos In Love (1987) IMO, Very Funny & Years Ahead Of It's Time - Low Budget Splatter Horror Parody

Call Me Tonight (1986) An obscure Japanese OVA that only runs a half hour - At the slightest titillation Ryo turns into a murderous deviant tentacle monster
Jerry Springer: The Opera- A genuine opera in which Jerry is killed and must host a show in Hell so the Devil can complain about being mistreated by God and Jesus
"Street Trash (1987) The peak of American 1980's bad taste cult - ""When a liquor store owner finds a case of ‚ÄúViper‚Äù in his cellar, he decides to sell it to the local hobos at one dollar a bottle, unaware of its true properties. The drinks causes its consumers to melt, very messily."""

critique
Test Tube Teens from the Year 2000 (Time Babes)
Slugs (1988) I always wondered why this film didn't have at least a minor cult following - One of the grossest horror movies ever uses a wide array of satisfyingly slimy practical effects - Based on an even grosser book

Serial Mom (1994) John Water's Final Great Film? Kathleen Turner & Mink Stole Are Amazing - Cocksucker!!!

Collision Course (1989) Even in the 80's I can't imagine when this ever seemed like a good idea - Look at the films it's comparing itself to!

Frankenhooker: A New Jersey mad doctor rebuilds his girlfriend with body parts from exploded hookers. He feels guilty about the idea of killing them, and performs a surgical method using a drill to his brain to calm himself and go through with the plan.
TRAIL OF THE SCREAMING FOREHEAD 2007 movie trailer Plot: A small town infestation of crawling alien foreheads that begin attaching to people and taking them over collides with a scientist's experiments to extract foreheadazine, and things go horribly wrong.
"Bubba Ho Tep 2002 movie trailer Plot: Elvis Presley and a black ""JFK"" stay in a nursing home where nothing happens - until a wayward Egyptian mummy comes and sucks out the old people's souls thru their a-holes. The two decide to fight back."

"Just finished Arrival (2016), and it is the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen. ""A linguist works with the military to communicate with alien lifeforms after twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world."""
"The Thing (1982) - If you're going to watch one horror movie tonight, make it The Thing. It is one of the best movies ever made and that's not just ""best horror"". Check it out!!"
Mean Girls (2004) is near perfect and likely the most quotable movie I've ever seen
What‚Äôs a good fucked up movie?
A complete stranger offers you $1,000,000 if you can recommend them 3 movies they haven't seen before and they end up rating at least one of them a 5/5.
The absolute most terrifying movie you‚Äôve ever seen.
I wanna watch a movie with a massive plot twist
Tremors (1990) is genuinely one of the most fun movies ever made
What‚Äôs the funniest movie of all time?
In Bruges (2008). Dark comedy at its finest.
Movies that goes dark , really dark Suddenly
Knives Out (10/10) .Need Some more recommendations like this
Shaun of the Dead (2004) is one of the best movies ever made and if I could only view one more film before I died, I would choose it
Suggest me something you believe is 10/10 and must be watched before you die.
What disturbing/fucked up movie do you recommend?
So nobody need ever ask again. 99 mind-fuck films
What's the most unsettling/creepiest horror movie you know?
I'm looking for depressing movies with no happy ending.
A friend once told me that he would not watch movies with an IMDB-rating less than 7.0, as they are a ‚Äòwaste of time‚Äô. I want to prove him wrong! Give me your favorite movies with an IMDB-rating with less than 7.0!

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been dancing with women for like 60 years‚Äù - Steven Seagal
Maximum Overdrive (1986) Stephen King‚Äôs first and only attempt at directing. Apparently he was so coked up during production that he doesn‚Äôt even remember making it. Saw this movie for the first time at way too young of an age. I‚Äôve loved it ever since.

But...isn't killing Carole Baskin immoral??
"The Movie ""It's Pat"" based on the SNL sketch of the same name, with a budget of $8 million - received $50k US and $60k Total at the box office"
A hilarious, yet objectively terrible flick
You haven‚Äôt lived if you haven‚Äôt watched this movie.

What Planet are you from? (2000) - all star cast but I‚Äôve never met another person who has seen it
This fighting scene from Scooby-Doo (2002) is so iconic! Sarah Michelle Gellar was amazing as Daphne.

Ted Cruz Has Cameo in Anti-Trans ‚ÄòComedy‚Äô ‚ÄòLady Ballers‚Äô

Today would've been Robert Z'Dars' 70th birthday. In the mainstream he is most famously known as a henchmen from Tango and Cash but in the cult movie world he was the star of the Maniac Cop trilogy. He also stared in Samurai Cop & Killing American Style. R.I.P, you will be remembered in the movies

Me when I show off my 4k collection
Found this while out for a walk with the dog!
About to be 17 this is my horror collection
The difference between 720p, 1080p, 1080i and 4K.
RIP my Best Buy's media section
Best Buy is confused why people arent buying physical media from their stores
True
It's complicated
Does 89 Batman count as a Christmas movie?
An abandoned dvd rental store diorama and yes‚Ä¶ the best part is its built in an old tvü§† also there‚Äôs hundreds of miniature dvds in itü•π
This man lost all but 20 of his movies (lost about 300 total) in a house fire. Strangers stepped up.
I finally got everything sorted and put into place
I‚Äôm my own Blockbuster Video now. Should I make a card?
Looks like someone's about to join the party.
I‚Äôve been lurking in this sub for a while now. Finally decided to share my collection! Let me know what you all think :)
This WAS a Living Room.
It's getting out of hand
Turned my apartment into a Home Theatre.

Me in r/DVDCollection for the rest of the year
Living room looking good :)
When someone tells you that streaming is easier than owning...
My prized movie collection.
Here‚Äôs my extensive DVD collection :) (upside of owning a video store)
whenever I see people call physical media outdated I always think of this
Thought I‚Äôd post my whole rainbow living room shelf as I‚Äôve been getting comments about it. I‚Äôm always tinkering with it, but this is what it currently looks like.
I seriously miss it more than I thought I would!
After a year I finally got all 2382 movies back on the shelves. Feels like home again.
My inner conflict when buying Blu Rays

My film collection as of September 2021
The Family Video I've been going to since 1990 announced they're closing down today, so I spent 90 minutes walking the aisles one last time and left with 15 movies. I'll forever miss this place!
Who else hates it when friends call you a ‚Äúhoarder?‚Äù
Finally able to display my collection after 5 years in storage
I only collect true cinema. Anything else is unworthy of my collection.
Kevin Smith is looking to offload his DVD collection
UPDATE: I Now Own 58 Copies Of The Matrix Reloaded on DVD
Me literally every time anyone posts a picture of their collection
The motivation is no longer there
I hope memes are allowed.

Any so bad they're good documentaries?
sage advice
‚ÄúPrisoners of the Lost Universe‚Äù (1983): Pretty self explanatory - If you can stomach the clip, I highly recommend you check it out. You‚Äôre in for a treat.  
Twin Sitters (1994) Words Fail Me - Peak 90's Cheese
Has anyone ever seen this absolute gem?
Rubber 2010: A car tire comes to life with the power to make people explode and goes on a murderous rampage through the California desert.
The Poonies (1985) When you turn a children's film into a porno and release it the same year as the real deal
Dead Heat (1988) - This movie is not a bad movie, but a B-Movie. It was made by a major studio, it had a good budget, it is well written, it has a star studded cast, and it had fantastic effect. The thing holding it back was mainstream audiences were not ready for a undead buddy cop movie.
Wild Zero (1999) A rock & roll Japanese zombie film - A cult favorite with a big following
"The U.S. avocado supply is in danger due to the ""Piranha"" tribe of cannibal women, who live in the mysterious ""Avocado Jungle"" and ritually sacrifice and eat men. The government recruits a professor of feminist studies to make contact with the women to convince them to move to a condo in Malibu 1989"
"Virgin Busters (1989) This Guy Is Peak 80's - ""The 'Virgin Busters' are called out to debunk a house being haunted by the sexually frustrated spirits of women who died before they lost their virginity."""
Blood Diner (1987) - An old favorite of mine, and beyond absurd.
Tetsuo The Iron Man 1989 movie trailer Japanese Horror Plot: A businessman accidentally kills The Metal Fetishist, who gets his revenge by slowly turning the man into a grotesque hybrid of flesh and rusty metal.
Problem Child 2 (1991) When Your Push Your Kids Comedy Film So Hard It Gets An Initial R-Rating - Like Some Kind Of Juvenile John Water's Film - Was Once In The IMDB's Bottom 100 Films
Linnea Quigley's Horror Workout - 1990 (Hope everyone is hydrated)
"[NSFW] The Dickheads (1993) The ""Peak"" Of The Porn Parody Genre - I Had The Same Face As The Guy In Back When I Discovered This [NSFW]"
Heavy Metal Parking Lot (1986) Full Movie - Interviews From The Parking Lot Of A Judas Priest Concert - Anyone Else Love Windows Into Another Time Like This?
"Pieces (1982) ""We've got abundant gore, awful dialogue, random kung-fu interludes, chainsaw dismemberment, waterbed slashing, red herrings everywhere, aerobics dance numbers, a shifty gardener, Edmond Purdom, & a cameo by an early 80‚Äôs Wendy‚Äôs drink cup & fry carton!"""
Frankenhooker (1990) Black Comedy B-Movies Don't Come Much Better - See It For The Exploding Crack/Prostitutes Scene - Patty Mullen Is Amazing
"Robot Holocaust (1986)""Zap guns & sword fights, soapy fantasy dialogue, clunky plastic robots, dark Mecha-Zoidberg, & beefcake in a barbarian bikini. It's like The Ice Pirates. But gay."""
I made Frank from Samurai Cop as a Mii.
Invasion of the Samurai Sluts from Hell! (1988) I Wonder If Anyone Rented This Thinking It Was Some Kind Of Troma Or Fred Olen Ray Film
"This one is produced somewhat well so maybe it's not as absurd as others, but ""Pilgrim"" on Hulu is a wild fuckin ride. My buddies and I got blasted and loved it."
Chopping Mall 1986 movie trailer Plot: A group of young shopping mall employees stay behind for a late night party in one of the stores. When the mall goes on lock-down before they can get out, the robot security system malfunctions, and goes on a killing spree
Bad news coming from 'Something Weird Video'. For anyone who does not know who they are, let just say that without these guys, MST3K, Rifftrax, AGFA, Vinegar Syndrome and 90% of cult critics wouldn't exist, or would be a shadow of there current selves.
I present Delivery Boys, the 1985 breakdancing film written and directed by Ken Doll Handler, heir to the Barbie fortune . No picture made breakdancing less cool than this. 80minutes of cringe with a happy ending . A must see bad movie. Tubi has it for free
critique
Test Tube Teens from the Year 2000 (Time Babes)
Slugs (1988) I always wondered why this film didn't have at least a minor cult following - One of the grossest horror movies ever uses a wide array of satisfyingly slimy practical effects - Based on an even grosser book
‚ÄúThe Greasy Strangler‚Äù - If Napoleon Dynamite was a horror movie
Serial Mom (1994) John Water's Final Great Film? Kathleen Turner & Mink Stole Are Amazing - Cocksucker!!!
Deathstalker II (1987) Self Aware Parody Or Painfully Cringe Shit Flick? I Honestly Can't Tell - Rarely Does A Film So Perfectly Walk The Line
Collision Course (1989) Even in the 80's I can't imagine when this ever seemed like a good idea - Look at the films it's comparing itself to!
The Bad Seed (1956) 8 Year Old Patty McCormack Is The Perfect Cinema Psychopath - Often Imitated, Never Duplicated
Mindkiller (1987) Awesome cover art that the film doesn't have a chance in hell of replicating - An 80's rental era phenomenon - HP Lovecraft Vibes? Kind of reminds me of From Beyond (Which I highly recommend)
Clifford (1994) ‚Äî Adult man plays creepy, sociopathic boy with a dinosaur fixation
Corona Zombie (2020) a lazy, poorly written, sexist, and all around offensive movie. Would recommend 7/10
Hiroshima (1953) Full Movie - Why are all the important anti-war films globally blocked? Extremely bleak and harrowing nuclear war film in the same vein as Threads or The Day After - Would you be willing to sign a petition to help this nearly lost film finally get a Criterion release?
Tales Of The Third Dimension (1984) The Most WTF American Horror Movie Ending Ever - Eat Your Heart Out David Lynch - Extremely Obscure Horror Anthology
Ants (1977) TV movie infamy - Ants in your pants - Of all the things to put the killer ants on breasts must of sold best
"The Man Who Saved the World (1982) (aka ""Turkish Star Wars"") - What can I say about this movie that has not already been said? This movie is one of the most infamous bad movies of all time."
The Bad Seed (1956) 8 Year Old Patty McCormack Is The Perfect Psychopath - She Delivers, IMO, One Of The Greatest Performances From A Child Actor Ever - A Defining, Fantastic Film
Frankenhooker: A New Jersey mad doctor rebuilds his girlfriend with body parts from exploded hookers. He feels guilty about the idea of killing them, and performs a surgical method using a drill to his brain to calm himself and go through with the plan.
TRAIL OF THE SCREAMING FOREHEAD 2007 movie trailer Plot: A small town infestation of crawling alien foreheads that begin attaching to people and taking them over collides with a scientist's experiments to extract foreheadazine, and things go horribly wrong.
"Bubba Ho Tep 2002 movie trailer Plot: Elvis Presley and a black ""JFK"" stay in a nursing home where nothing happens - until a wayward Egyptian mummy comes and sucks out the old people's souls thru their a-holes. The two decide to fight back."
AUNTIE LEE MEAT PIES SURE ARE TASTY CAW CAW
started in November of 2019 my friends and I have been watching (mostly) bad movies on Friday nights. we are about to hit 200 movies watched this weekend and here is our complete list of what has been watched. Would love some suggestions of future movies to watch as well!
Bride of the Monster (1955) Ed Wood - Bela Lugosi's final speaking role is lively & enduring - A cheesy b-movie that instantly grows on you
"Debbie Does Demons (2023) - This movie really should have just been a softcore porn. It's sort of a soft-softcore porn; porn-light, if you will. All that means is that we get no sex, but a metric ass load of tits. Personifying this is big titty demon who is topless 75% of the movie."
Meet The Feebles Trailer 1989
Blood Debts (1985) Undoubtedly One Of The Finest Film Endings Of All Time - Not Since Ninja Terminator Has A Film Ended With Such Nuance
[NSFW]Killing In The Nude (1985) Asian Erotica Just Hits Differently - Gotta Put Some Kung Fu In Your Porn![NSFW]
Freaks (1932) A Masterpiece Of Classic Cinema - Hugely Controversial At It's Release - Highly Recommended
"La Cravate aka The Severed Heads (1957) Full Movie - For My Birthday, I'd Like To Gift You All This - Jodorowsky's 1st Ever Film Is A Surreal Mime Short - ""About a Parisian urchin who makes her living selling human heads."""
X-ray Punch from The Street Fighter (1974) - Hosting a Sonny Chiba Marathon ft The StreetFighter tomorrow - 19/6 12pm GMT - Link in comments
Woodchipper Massacre (1988) Full Movie - This Shot On Video, Micro Budget Shit Flick (Somehow) Occupies A Special Place In My Heart
Female Trouble (1974) Edith Massey Said It Best - John Waters Is A Treasure Of American Cult Film Making
Killer Klowns From Outer Space 1988 movie trailer Plot: Aliens who look like clowns come from outer space and terrorize a small town.
"Happiness (1998) ""The lives of many individuals connected by the desire for happiness, often from sources usually considered dark or evil."" - IMO Todd Solondz's two 90's films are among the finest American movies of the past 30+ years"
Orca (1977) The Humble Little PG Film That Traumatized An Entire Generation Of Children - IMHO The Best Of The Post Jaws Wave Despite It's Absurdity!
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes 1978 movie trailer Plot: A group of scientists band together to save the world from mutated killer tomatoes.
Starting in November of 2019 my friends and I have watched (mostly) bad movies every Friday night. Last night we crossed off movie 400. Here's a list of what we've wasted our lives on.
"Street Trash (1987) - I suspect many of you may already be aware of this movie. It is somewhat of a minor cult classic. A well deserved title I might add mostly due to it's impressive practical effects. ""This is the best Troma movie, Troma never made."" a fellow group member rightly observed."
But I'm a Cheerleader (1999)
The Eroticist (1972) A Lucio Fulci Sex Comedy?! A Politician Who's OBSESSED With The Female Ass - In All Honesty, One Of The Best Sex Comedies Ever
Danger Diabolik (1968) European Cinema Of This Era Is Among My All Time Favorites - Like The Evil LSD Spawn Of James Bond & 1960's Batman - He Out Does The Bat Cave!!! Legendary Cult
The Lair of White Worm (1988) A lesser known Ken Russel movie with killer bagpipe scene
Street Trash (1987) Toxic Hooch Melts Hobos! - Important Cornerstone Cult With Fantastic Practical FX And A Great Cast Of B-Actors
"And I Do Windows... Too! (1986) ""John Leslie is a man with a quest. He's in search of an extraordinary, multi talented female who - in addition to performing in the bedroom - can also wield a spray bottle and rag."" The Lost Art Of The Porno Comedy (With A Real Story line, And Acting!)"
just ran across this
Bride of Re-Animator (1990) H.P Lovecraft - Talk About An Overlooked B-Movie Horror Series - Jeffrey Combs Just Kills It Each & Every Time I See Him
Desperate Living (1977) Mink Stole is one of the funniest female performers ever IMO - Communist Daycare! John Water's third 70's trash classic is peak Stole - Sexy AND crazy!
Welcome To The Dollhouse (1995) One Of My Favorites - Matarazzo Is Amazing - A Bleak Black Comedy
Basket Case (1991) Not The Worst Way To End A Low Budget Horror Series - Really Jumps The Shark/Goes Off The Rails
[NSFW]The Suckling (1990) A Film Done In Such Bad Taste It Makes Frankenhooker Look Modest In Comparison[NSFW]
Jason X 2001 movie trailer Plot: Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century.

started in November of 2019 my friends and I have been watching (mostly) bad movies on Friday nights. we are about to hit 200 movies watched this weekend and here is our complete list of what has been watched. Would love some suggestions of future movies to watch as well!
Bride of the Monster (1955) Ed Wood - Bela Lugosi's final speaking role is lively & enduring - A cheesy b-movie that instantly grows on you
"Debbie Does Demons (2023) - This movie really should have just been a softcore porn. It's sort of a soft-softcore porn; porn-light, if you will. All that means is that we get no sex, but a metric ass load of tits. Personifying this is big titty demon who is topless 75% of the movie."
Meet The Feebles Trailer 1989
Blood Debts (1985) Undoubtedly One Of The Finest Film Endings Of All Time - Not Since Ninja Terminator Has A Film Ended With Such Nuance

Starting in November of 2019 my friends and I have watched (mostly) bad movies every Friday night. Last night we crossed off movie 400. Here's a list of what we've wasted our lives on.
"Street Trash (1987) - I suspect many of you may already be aware of this movie. It is somewhat of a minor cult classic. A well deserved title I might add mostly due to it's impressive practical effects. ""This is the best Troma movie, Troma never made."" a fellow group member rightly observed."

just ran across this
Bride of Re-Animator (1990) H.P Lovecraft - Talk About An Overlooked B-Movie Horror Series - Jeffrey Combs Just Kills It Each & Every Time I See Him
Desperate Living (1977) Mink Stole is one of the funniest female performers ever IMO - Communist Daycare! John Water's third 70's trash classic is peak Stole - Sexy AND crazy!
Welcome To The Dollhouse (1995) One Of My Favorites - Matarazzo Is Amazing - A Bleak Black Comedy

Ed Wood (1994) A touching tribute to a misunderstood man who would be an icon today - IMO Burton's best film ever - Firmly in my top 20 movies, and Ed Wood is one of my few heroes
Neil Breen Wants To Kill You (Well, Most of You) In His Movie Pass Thru -
Cyber Tracker 2 - discount Robocop anyone?
Psychos In Love (1987) IMO, Very Funny & Years Ahead Of It's Time - Low Budget Splatter Horror Parody
THE GUYVER 1991 movie trailer Plot: A young man discovers a mechanical device that merges with his own body, turning him into a cyborg superhero. When strange creatures start appearing, trying to take the device back, he begins to uncover a secret plot to genetically engineer terrifying monsters.

And their lives are on the line. Soundtrack includes ‚ÄúLineman‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Lineman.‚Äù They really want you to know they‚Äôre linemen.

Everyone talks about the Star Wars Holiday Special - nobody ever brings up the awful Ewok movies starring Wilford Brimley
Today would've been Robert Z'Dars' 70th birthday. In the mainstream he is most famously known as a henchmen from Tango and Cash but in the cult movie world he was the star of the Maniac Cop trilogy. He also stared in Samurai Cop & Killing American Style. R.I.P, you will be remembered in the movies
I‚Äôve got a busy weekend ahead.
Munchie (1992) Even with MST3K this one was rough, but unriffed it was nearly impossible

Has anyone heard of this? 'Death Race 2000'
Crust (2003) is about an English pub owner who teaches a GIANT shrimp to box
"Anyone seen this gem of bad zombie movie from the 80s? I wasn't expecting anything good but when the zombie talked at the beginning. I knew it was ""winner"" worth finishing"
The Running Man (1987) is it good good or good bad? As far as 80s cheese goes - I think it gets the balance right but I want to hear your thoughts
Tonight‚Äôs gem. Starring and Directed by Kevin Sorbo

"Bearded vultures are the only species to have a diet primarily made up of bone (70-90%). The larger bones are dropped on to rocky slopes in order to break them. If the bone does not break the first time, the method is repeated many times until the bone finally breaks."
"Scientists have successfully developed a revolutionary eye scanner that can discover a person's biological age by examining their eye lens. According to the researchers, the chronological age (the time one spends alive) does not adequately measure the rate of aging of a person already."
"Old bonobos, like aging humans, suffer from long-sightedness and could use glasses. This suggests long-sightedness is not a product of modern lifestyles, but a natural part of aging."
"The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies rewards dolphins with a fish for keeping their pools clean, if they bring a piece of litter or dead gull to a trainer. Kelly the dolphin tears pieces of litter into smaller pieces for more rewards and stockpiles fish to lure and kill gulls."
Mortality rate for Black babies is cut dramatically when Black doctors care for them after birth
"The recent excavation of a cave site along Portugal's coast revealed a wealth of fossilized remains of food, including fish, birds and mammals. It's estimated that Neanderthals lived in the cave, known as Figueira Brava, between 86,000 and 106,000 years ago."

"The last surviving flightless species of bird, a type of rail, in the Indian Ocean had previously gone extinct but has risen from the dead thanks to a rare process called 'iterative evolution'(the repeated evolution of similar or parallel structures from the same ancestor but at different times)."
"Dust baths are necessary for chinchillas to counterbalance their naturally oily skin and to maintain their soft fur. In their native home in South America, chinchillas might roll in volcanic ash to stay clean — hence, why they require a special process in areas not teeming with this ash."
"Hyraxes are rotund herbivorous mammals native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. Despite their rodent-like appearance, they are elephants' closest living relative. Hyraxes are colonial, living in colonies of about 50 within the natural crevices of rocks or boulders. They do not create burrows."
Cockroaches of the species Salganea taiwanensis are monogomous. They complete their bond by gnawing off each other’s wings. The couple takes turns chewing each other’s wings down to stubs after they move into the homes where they will jointly raise babies.

"This gif, created by Google product developer Clay Bavor, puts the 747 and SR-71 aircraft speeds into perspective compared to New Horizons spacecraft. 36,000 mph ~ 58,000 km/h was the speed reached at launch (Atlas V third stage cut off)"
"Leucochloridium is a parasitic worm that infects snails. It takes over motor function in the eye stalks, making them into caterpillar mimetics so that birds will eat them. The worm can then reproduce in the bird's GI tract, eventually transmitting via its feces."
"Ants use pheromones to follow trails. If a trail loops, they get locked running in a circle and die from exhaustion. This is called an ant mill."
"When a horse is running, its breathing and stride are linked in a 1:1 ratio, so for every stride they take, they also take one breath. The peak airflow they generate is very high (about 80 liters per second). Thus, a very small defect in the airway can cause a big decrease in performance."
A fungus observed inside Chernobyl is a radiation extremophile that could inspire new technology. It absorbs normally harmful rays which it then converts into chemical energy (radiosynthesis). The fungi use high amounts of melanin to resist radiation and turn it into energy.

"Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defense. The acid gives off a pungent odor, but does't hurt unless it gets into an open wound, which is most often caused by the ants biting with their powerful jaws. The acid fumes also irritate the nose and mouth causing coughing and choking."
"Most geckos do not possess eyelids; they feature a clear scale that covers the eye. Because they can’t blink, they lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist, with the tongue acting like a windshield wiper."
"Dr. Donald Unger cracked his knuckles every day for 60 years to see if it would cause arthritis. Unger would crack his knuckles on one hand every day and leave the other one as a control. After 60 years, there was no discernible difference between them and Unger won the Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine."
"Bats are often mistaken as rodents, but in fact they belong to their own mammalian order called Chiroptera. They are more closely related to cats than rats."
"Crabs, such as this Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi), cannot grow in a linear fashion like most animals. Because they have a hard outer shell (the exoskeleton) that does not grow, they must shed their shells, a process called molting."
"Menthol makes our mouths and noses feel cold because it binds to the cold receptor protein and activates it. Since our experience of cold is our brain receiving the message that these neurons have been activated, the feeling from menthol is identical to the feeling of actual cold."
"Acanthaspis petax, a type of assassin bug, stacks dead ant bodies on its back to confuse predators."
"In 1941 the world’s largest seed bank (created by botanist Nikolai Vavilov) was housed in Leningrad. As the Germans surrounded the city forcing mass starvation, Vavilov’s scientists refused to eat from the collection, slowly dying of hunger as they maintained 16 rooms of edible plants."
"It's fair to say planets orbit the Sun, but that's not 100% true. The Sun holds 99.8% of the Solar System's mass; Jupiter contains most of what's left and as a result plays tug of war with the Sun. Everything orbits a center of mass!"
The Galton Board is a 19cm by 10cm (7.5in by 4.5in) desktop probability machine. It demonstrates the statistical concept of normal distribution.
"When hunting, a thresher shark's tail moves so quickly that it lowers the pressure in front of it, causing the water to boil. Small bubbles are released, and collapse again when the water pressure equalizes. This process is called cavitation, and it releases huge amounts of energy stunning the fish."
"The way we view the cosmo has come a long way technology-wise. These images are the Whirlpool Galaxy, a comparison between 1845 and 2005. The image from 1845 was drawn by William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, while looking through his telescope ""Leviathan."""

Previously thought to be extinct, 300+ members of this critically endangered species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad, were born from sperm previously frozen - hence named after the Disney character - in order to save the species from extinction."
"There is a woman with a ‘mutant’ gene who feels no pain and heals without scarring. She reported numerous injuries without pain, often smelling her burning flesh before noticing any injury."
"Spider webs don’t rot easily because bacteria that would aid decomposition are unable to access the silk’s nitrogen, a nutrient the microbes need for growth and reproduction."
"A new study suggests the human brain is capable of responding to the Earth’s magnetic field, though at an unconscious level. It’s not clear if our apparent ability to sense the magnetic field is in any way useful, as it’s likely a vestigial trait left over from our more primitive past."
"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis removes cells during development, eliminates potentially cancerous and virus-infected cells, and maintains balance in the body."
"Astronomers believe they have found a habitiable system about 11 light years away from us. The system — GJ 887 — has an unusually quiet red dwarf host, has two planets for sure and another likely that orbits at a life-friendly 50-day orbit. It is the 12th closest planetary system to our sun."
"Marine iguanas sneeze frequently to expel salt from glands near their noses. The salt often lands on their heads, giving them a distinctive white wig."
Box turtles are the only turtles in North America with a flexible hinge on their belly to close the front and rear halves of the shell tightly like a box.

"In 2016, 10 psychiatrists studied 400 movies to find the most realistic psychopath. Anton Chigurh from ""No Country for Old Men"" came in 1st. More iconic psychopaths, including Patrick Bateman (""American Psycho"") were deemed to not quite fit the psychopath mold."
Bumblebees can solve a simple problem; pulling string to get food. They can pick this skill up even quicker by watching other bees perform the task first!
Butterflies congregate on turtles' and crocodilians' eyes to drink their tears. They need salt and the tears of these reptiles are an easy way to obtain it.
"All tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis tree. The difference between green tea, black tea, white tea, yellow tea, and oolong tea comes from how the leaves oxidize. White tea is the least oxidized tea, followed by green tea, Oolong tea, then black tea."
"Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the ""love hormone"" or ""cuddle hormone"" is a neuromodulator that plays important roles in pair bonding, birthing, breastfeeding, stress regulation, and social bonding.

"Leucochloridium is a parasitic worm that infects snails. It takes over motor function in the eye stalks, making them into caterpillar mimetics so that birds will eat them. The worm can then reproduce in the bird's GI tract, eventually transmitting via its feces."
"Ants use pheromones to follow trails. If a trail loops, they get locked running in a circle and die from exhaustion. This is called an ant mill."
"When a horse is running, its breathing and stride are linked in a 1:1 ratio, so for every stride they take, they also take one breath. The peak airflow they generate is very high (about 80 liters per second). Thus, a very small defect in the airway can cause a big decrease in performance."

"Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defense. The acid gives off a pungent odor, but does't hurt unless it gets into an open wound, which is most often caused by the ants biting with their powerful jaws. The acid fumes also irritate the nose and mouth causing coughing and choking."
"Most geckos do not possess eyelids; they feature a clear scale that covers the eye. Because they can’t blink, they lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist, with the tongue acting like a windshield wiper."

"Leucochloridium is a parasitic worm that infects snails. It takes over motor function in the eye stalks, making them into caterpillar mimetics so that birds will eat them. The worm can then reproduce in the bird's GI tract, eventually transmitting via its feces."
"Ants use pheromones to follow trails. If a trail loops, they get locked running in a circle and die from exhaustion. This is called an ant mill."
"When a horse is running, its breathing and stride are linked in a 1:1 ratio, so for every stride they take, they also take one breath. The peak airflow they generate is very high (about 80 liters per second). Thus, a very small defect in the airway can cause a big decrease in performance."
A fungus observed inside Chernobyl is a radiation extremophile that could inspire new technology. It absorbs normally harmful rays which it then converts into chemical energy (radiosynthesis). The fungi use high amounts of melanin to resist radiation and turn it into energy.

"Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defense. The acid gives off a pungent odor, but does't hurt unless it gets into an open wound, which is most often caused by the ants biting with their powerful jaws. The acid fumes also irritate the nose and mouth causing coughing and choking."
"Most geckos do not possess eyelids; they feature a clear scale that covers the eye. Because they can’t blink, they lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist, with the tongue acting like a windshield wiper."
"Dr. Donald Unger cracked his knuckles every day for 60 years to see if it would cause arthritis. Unger would crack his knuckles on one hand every day and leave the other one as a control. After 60 years, there was no discernible difference between them and Unger won the Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine."
"Bats are often mistaken as rodents, but in fact they belong to their own mammalian order called Chiroptera. They are more closely related to cats than rats."
"Crabs, such as this Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi), cannot grow in a linear fashion like most animals. Because they have a hard outer shell (the exoskeleton) that does not grow, they must shed their shells, a process called molting."
"Menthol makes our mouths and noses feel cold because it binds to the cold receptor protein and activates it. Since our experience of cold is our brain receiving the message that these neurons have been activated, the feeling from menthol is identical to the feeling of actual cold."

"There is a woman with a ‘mutant’ gene who feels no pain and heals without scarring. She reported numerous injuries without pain, often smelling her burning flesh before noticing any injury."
"Spider webs don’t rot easily because bacteria that would aid decomposition are unable to access the silk’s nitrogen, a nutrient the microbes need for growth and reproduction."
"A new study suggests the human brain is capable of responding to the Earth’s magnetic field, though at an unconscious level. It’s not clear if our apparent ability to sense the magnetic field is in any way useful, as it’s likely a vestigial trait left over from our more primitive past."
"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis removes cells during development, eliminates potentially cancerous and virus-infected cells, and maintains balance in the body."
"Astronomers believe they have found a habitiable system about 11 light years away from us. The system — GJ 887 — has an unusually quiet red dwarf host, has two planets for sure and another likely that orbits at a life-friendly 50-day orbit. It is the 12th closest planetary system to our sun."

"Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defense. The acid gives off a pungent odor, but does't hurt unless it gets into an open wound, which is most often caused by the ants biting with their powerful jaws. The acid fumes also irritate the nose and mouth causing coughing and choking."
"Most geckos do not possess eyelids; they feature a clear scale that covers the eye. Because they can’t blink, they lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist, with the tongue acting like a windshield wiper."
"Dr. Donald Unger cracked his knuckles every day for 60 years to see if it would cause arthritis. Unger would crack his knuckles on one hand every day and leave the other one as a control. After 60 years, there was no discernible difference between them and Unger won the Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine."
"Bats are often mistaken as rodents, but in fact they belong to their own mammalian order called Chiroptera. They are more closely related to cats than rats."
"Crabs, such as this Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi), cannot grow in a linear fashion like most animals. Because they have a hard outer shell (the exoskeleton) that does not grow, they must shed their shells, a process called molting."
"Menthol makes our mouths and noses feel cold because it binds to the cold receptor protein and activates it. Since our experience of cold is our brain receiving the message that these neurons have been activated, the feeling from menthol is identical to the feeling of actual cold."
"Acanthaspis petax, a type of assassin bug, stacks dead ant bodies on its back to confuse predators."
"In 1941 the world’s largest seed bank (created by botanist Nikolai Vavilov) was housed in Leningrad. As the Germans surrounded the city forcing mass starvation, Vavilov’s scientists refused to eat from the collection, slowly dying of hunger as they maintained 16 rooms of edible plants."
"It's fair to say planets orbit the Sun, but that's not 100% true. The Sun holds 99.8% of the Solar System's mass; Jupiter contains most of what's left and as a result plays tug of war with the Sun. Everything orbits a center of mass!"

Previously thought to be extinct, 300+ members of this critically endangered species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad, were born from sperm previously frozen - hence named after the Disney character - in order to save the species from extinction."
"There is a woman with a ‘mutant’ gene who feels no pain and heals without scarring. She reported numerous injuries without pain, often smelling her burning flesh before noticing any injury."
"Spider webs don’t rot easily because bacteria that would aid decomposition are unable to access the silk’s nitrogen, a nutrient the microbes need for growth and reproduction."
"A new study suggests the human brain is capable of responding to the Earth’s magnetic field, though at an unconscious level. It’s not clear if our apparent ability to sense the magnetic field is in any way useful, as it’s likely a vestigial trait left over from our more primitive past."

"Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defense. The acid gives off a pungent odor, but does't hurt unless it gets into an open wound, which is most often caused by the ants biting with their powerful jaws. The acid fumes also irritate the nose and mouth causing coughing and choking."
"Most geckos do not possess eyelids; they feature a clear scale that covers the eye. Because they can’t blink, they lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist, with the tongue acting like a windshield wiper."

"Leucochloridium is a parasitic worm that infects snails. It takes over motor function in the eye stalks, making them into caterpillar mimetics so that birds will eat them. The worm can then reproduce in the bird's GI tract, eventually transmitting via its feces."
"Ants use pheromones to follow trails. If a trail loops, they get locked running in a circle and die from exhaustion. This is called an ant mill."
"When a horse is running, its breathing and stride are linked in a 1:1 ratio, so for every stride they take, they also take one breath. The peak airflow they generate is very high (about 80 liters per second). Thus, a very small defect in the airway can cause a big decrease in performance."

"Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defense. The acid gives off a pungent odor, but does't hurt unless it gets into an open wound, which is most often caused by the ants biting with their powerful jaws. The acid fumes also irritate the nose and mouth causing coughing and choking."
"Most geckos do not possess eyelids; they feature a clear scale that covers the eye. Because they can’t blink, they lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist, with the tongue acting like a windshield wiper."
"Dr. Donald Unger cracked his knuckles every day for 60 years to see if it would cause arthritis. Unger would crack his knuckles on one hand every day and leave the other one as a control. After 60 years, there was no discernible difference between them and Unger won the Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine."
"Bats are often mistaken as rodents, but in fact they belong to their own mammalian order called Chiroptera. They are more closely related to cats than rats."
"Crabs, such as this Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi), cannot grow in a linear fashion like most animals. Because they have a hard outer shell (the exoskeleton) that does not grow, they must shed their shells, a process called molting."
"Menthol makes our mouths and noses feel cold because it binds to the cold receptor protein and activates it. Since our experience of cold is our brain receiving the message that these neurons have been activated, the feeling from menthol is identical to the feeling of actual cold."
"Acanthaspis petax, a type of assassin bug, stacks dead ant bodies on its back to confuse predators."
"In 1941 the world’s largest seed bank (created by botanist Nikolai Vavilov) was housed in Leningrad. As the Germans surrounded the city forcing mass starvation, Vavilov’s scientists refused to eat from the collection, slowly dying of hunger as they maintained 16 rooms of edible plants."
"It's fair to say planets orbit the Sun, but that's not 100% true. The Sun holds 99.8% of the Solar System's mass; Jupiter contains most of what's left and as a result plays tug of war with the Sun. Everything orbits a center of mass!"
The Galton Board is a 19cm by 10cm (7.5in by 4.5in) desktop probability machine. It demonstrates the statistical concept of normal distribution.

Previously thought to be extinct, 300+ members of this critically endangered species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad, were born from sperm previously frozen - hence named after the Disney character - in order to save the species from extinction."
"There is a woman with a ‘mutant’ gene who feels no pain and heals without scarring. She reported numerous injuries without pain, often smelling her burning flesh before noticing any injury."
"Spider webs don’t rot easily because bacteria that would aid decomposition are unable to access the silk’s nitrogen, a nutrient the microbes need for growth and reproduction."
"A new study suggests the human brain is capable of responding to the Earth’s magnetic field, though at an unconscious level. It’s not clear if our apparent ability to sense the magnetic field is in any way useful, as it’s likely a vestigial trait left over from our more primitive past."
"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis removes cells during development, eliminates potentially cancerous and virus-infected cells, and maintains balance in the body."
"Astronomers believe they have found a habitiable system about 11 light years away from us. The system — GJ 887 — has an unusually quiet red dwarf host, has two planets for sure and another likely that orbits at a life-friendly 50-day orbit. It is the 12th closest planetary system to our sun."
"Marine iguanas sneeze frequently to expel salt from glands near their noses. The salt often lands on their heads, giving them a distinctive white wig."

"Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defense. The acid gives off a pungent odor, but does't hurt unless it gets into an open wound, which is most often caused by the ants biting with their powerful jaws. The acid fumes also irritate the nose and mouth causing coughing and choking."
"Most geckos do not possess eyelids; they feature a clear scale that covers the eye. Because they can’t blink, they lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist, with the tongue acting like a windshield wiper."

"Leucochloridium is a parasitic worm that infects snails. It takes over motor function in the eye stalks, making them into caterpillar mimetics so that birds will eat them. The worm can then reproduce in the bird's GI tract, eventually transmitting via its feces."
"Ants use pheromones to follow trails. If a trail loops, they get locked running in a circle and die from exhaustion. This is called an ant mill."
"When a horse is running, its breathing and stride are linked in a 1:1 ratio, so for every stride they take, they also take one breath. The peak airflow they generate is very high (about 80 liters per second). Thus, a very small defect in the airway can cause a big decrease in performance."
A fungus observed inside Chernobyl is a radiation extremophile that could inspire new technology. It absorbs normally harmful rays which it then converts into chemical energy (radiosynthesis). The fungi use high amounts of melanin to resist radiation and turn it into energy.

"Dust baths are necessary for chinchillas to counterbalance their naturally oily skin and to maintain their soft fur. In their native home in South America, chinchillas might roll in volcanic ash to stay clean — hence, why they require a special process in areas not teeming with this ash."
"Hyraxes are rotund herbivorous mammals native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. Despite their rodent-like appearance, they are elephants' closest living relative. Hyraxes are colonial, living in colonies of about 50 within the natural crevices of rocks or boulders. They do not create burrows."
Cockroaches of the species Salganea taiwanensis are monogomous. They complete their bond by gnawing off each other’s wings. The couple takes turns chewing each other’s wings down to stubs after they move into the homes where they will jointly raise babies.
The average cloud contains 500 tons of water (1.1 million pounds).
"This sea anemone now has the largest animal mitochondrial genome on record, at almost 81,000 base pairs. Humans have fewer than 17,000. ""These ancient animals have simple behavior and simple anatomy, and so we’ve thought of them as fairly simple creatures until now."""
"Bonobos, the friendly hippies of the primate world, are willing to help strangers even if there’s nothing in it for them. This shows that humans aren’t unique in their kindness to strangers, and suggests that such behavior may have evolved among our closest relatives."
"Dr. Edith Patch, an aphid specialist, was the first female president of the Entomological Society of America. She was one of the early scientists to write and speak of the threats to the environment from the widespread applications of chemical insecticides."

"Leucochloridium is a parasitic worm that infects snails. It takes over motor function in the eye stalks, making them into caterpillar mimetics so that birds will eat them. The worm can then reproduce in the bird's GI tract, eventually transmitting via its feces."
"Ants use pheromones to follow trails. If a trail loops, they get locked running in a circle and die from exhaustion. This is called an ant mill."
"When a horse is running, its breathing and stride are linked in a 1:1 ratio, so for every stride they take, they also take one breath. The peak airflow they generate is very high (about 80 liters per second). Thus, a very small defect in the airway can cause a big decrease in performance."
A fungus observed inside Chernobyl is a radiation extremophile that could inspire new technology. It absorbs normally harmful rays which it then converts into chemical energy (radiosynthesis). The fungi use high amounts of melanin to resist radiation and turn it into energy.
"In preparation for the annual spawning season of the Red crab, rangers on Christmas Island put up barriers along the roadside to prevent the crabs from being crushed by cars. They have also constructed a 5 m high bridge to help the crabs move across the island and continue their migration."

"Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defense. The acid gives off a pungent odor, but does't hurt unless it gets into an open wound, which is most often caused by the ants biting with their powerful jaws. The acid fumes also irritate the nose and mouth causing coughing and choking."
"Most geckos do not possess eyelids; they feature a clear scale that covers the eye. Because they can’t blink, they lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist, with the tongue acting like a windshield wiper."
"Dr. Donald Unger cracked his knuckles every day for 60 years to see if it would cause arthritis. Unger would crack his knuckles on one hand every day and leave the other one as a control. After 60 years, there was no discernible difference between them and Unger won the Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine."
"Bats are often mistaken as rodents, but in fact they belong to their own mammalian order called Chiroptera. They are more closely related to cats than rats."
"Crabs, such as this Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi), cannot grow in a linear fashion like most animals. Because they have a hard outer shell (the exoskeleton) that does not grow, they must shed their shells, a process called molting."
"Menthol makes our mouths and noses feel cold because it binds to the cold receptor protein and activates it. Since our experience of cold is our brain receiving the message that these neurons have been activated, the feeling from menthol is identical to the feeling of actual cold."

"There is a woman with a ‘mutant’ gene who feels no pain and heals without scarring. She reported numerous injuries without pain, often smelling her burning flesh before noticing any injury."
"Spider webs don’t rot easily because bacteria that would aid decomposition are unable to access the silk’s nitrogen, a nutrient the microbes need for growth and reproduction."
"A new study suggests the human brain is capable of responding to the Earth’s magnetic field, though at an unconscious level. It’s not clear if our apparent ability to sense the magnetic field is in any way useful, as it’s likely a vestigial trait left over from our more primitive past."
"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis removes cells during development, eliminates potentially cancerous and virus-infected cells, and maintains balance in the body."
"Astronomers believe they have found a habitiable system about 11 light years away from us. The system — GJ 887 — has an unusually quiet red dwarf host, has two planets for sure and another likely that orbits at a life-friendly 50-day orbit. It is the 12th closest planetary system to our sun."

"In 2016, 10 psychiatrists studied 400 movies to find the most realistic psychopath. Anton Chigurh from ""No Country for Old Men"" came in 1st. More iconic psychopaths, including Patrick Bateman (""American Psycho"") were deemed to not quite fit the psychopath mold."
Bumblebees can solve a simple problem; pulling string to get food. They can pick this skill up even quicker by watching other bees perform the task first!
Butterflies congregate on turtles' and crocodilians' eyes to drink their tears. They need salt and the tears of these reptiles are an easy way to obtain it.
"All tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis tree. The difference between green tea, black tea, white tea, yellow tea, and oolong tea comes from how the leaves oxidize. White tea is the least oxidized tea, followed by green tea, Oolong tea, then black tea."
"Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the ""love hormone"" or ""cuddle hormone"" is a neuromodulator that plays important roles in pair bonding, birthing, breastfeeding, stress regulation, and social bonding.

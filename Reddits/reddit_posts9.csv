What harsh truth do you prefer not to think about?

I ask God to take me away often.
The way people sparkle when they talk about the things they love is so wholesome.
"People are expected to make good life decisions with no practice. In no other area of life does this make sense. Athletes put countless hours into doing what they do well. How much actual practice do people get at making life decisions before they must perform? Most often, none."

Bored on a train. What’s the most profound thing that anyone has ever said to you?
Can you be both pro-life and pro-choice?
Has social media ruined our society beyond repair?
Mental illness is so rampant because we’re not evolved enough to live in the society we created for ourselves

Love not being guaranteed in life is one of the saddest things.
i wish the world would stop so that i can sit outside and experience living
What is your strongest argument for and against the existence of God?
"if hell by definition is just a absence of God, and I don't see a God anywhere, are we in hell?"

Am confused why humans choose to create humans
"When I die don't come to my grave and sit there for hours and tell me you love me and miss me, because those are the things I wanted to hear when I was alive."
We are thrown into bodies we never picked and told to act according to what other bodies “that look like us” act

"If Jeff Bezos, alone, simply made $10 billion instead of $100 billion from Amazon, the lowest paid 300,000 workers at that company could have gotten $300,000 each, creating hundreds of thousands of financially stable families with retirement prospects."
"If everything going on with the world is so bad, why aren't people willing to fight? Have we all just become cowards?"
We think we want sex. It's not always about sex. It's the intimacy we want. To be touched. Looked at. Admired. Smiled At. Laugh with someone. Feel safe. Feel like someone's really got you. That's what we often crave.
The universe is 3.5 days old in human years.
